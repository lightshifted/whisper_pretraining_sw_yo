# ðŸŽ¯ Project Plan

The goal of this project is to fine-tune the Whisper model to improve the accuracy of speech recognition in the Swahili and Yoruba languages. To achieve this goal, we will use a large dataset of audio samples in these languages to train the model and optimize its performance.

We will also develop a user-friendly interface for the speech recognition system that allows users to easily interact with the model and obtain accurate transcriptions of their speech in real-time. This interface can be easily integrated into existing speech recognition applications and platforms to expand their capabilities and make them more accessible to users of the Swahili and Yoruba languages.

Additionally, we will create a community of users and developers who can contribute to the project by providing feedback, suggestions, and additional data to further improve the performance of the speech recognition system. This community will allow us to continuously improve the model and make it more effective for users of the Swahili and Yoruba languages.

| Week | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1    | - Conduct initial research on the structure and characteristics of the Swahili and Yoruba languages.<br>- Identify any unique challenges or opportunities for building speech recognition systems for these languages.<br>- Begin fine-tuning the Whisper model using a small dataset of Swahili and Yoruba speech data.<br>- Monitor and adjust the model as needed to optimize its performance on these languages. |
| 2    | - Expand the dataset to include a wider range of voices and accents in both languages.<br>- Continue fine-tuning the Whisper model using the expanded dataset. |
| 3    | - Finalize the fine-tuned Whisper model and evaluate its performance on the "test" split of the Common Voice 11 dataset.<br>- Develop the user-friendly interface for the speech recognition system.<br>- Begin outreach and engagement with the community to gather feedback and suggestions for improving the model. |
| Ongoing | - Continuously improve the fine-tuned Whisper model based on feedback from the community and additional data.<br>- Work with existing speech recognition applications and platforms to integrate the fine-tuned Whisper model.<br>- Continue to engage with the community and encourage contributions to the project. |
