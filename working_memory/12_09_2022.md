### 🏹 Day's Tasks

* Complete preprocessing of all Swahili datasets.

* Read and review the project README.md for potential changes.
* Work on solving the audio and transcript interval split. Much work has been done torwards this effort, however work still remains.
* Modify model storage file structure so it's streamlined for easier loading during training runs.
* Finalize training pipeline for locally stored data
* Implement `run_eval_whisper_streaming.py` [script](https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/blob/main/whisper-fine-tuning-event/run_eval_whisper_streaming.py) into custom training loop. This will speed up the evaluation process.

### 🎯 Progress Made
* [Done] Finalize the script for Gradio demo on HuggingFace space.
* [Done] Complete training of whisper-large-v2-sw and upload model to HuggingFace
* [Done] Review steps for accessing Whisper community-event leaderboard.

### 📃 Work for December 8th, 2022
* Replace "</s>" with "" in dataset `kenspeech.txt` 
* Normalize `kenspeech.txt` and `babel.txt` datasets (e.g. remove start and end special tokens, punctuation, and certain special characters.)

### 💡 Notes / Ideas

* Reviewing the day's accomplishments and work remaining each night is paramount to achieving my goals.
* Each morning, review my list of the day's tasks and craft a daily plan incorporating them.
* Common Voice 11.0 and Google Fleurs corpora are normalized. KenSpeech, Broadcast News, and Babel corpora contain special tokens. Our model will be fine-tuned on the former datasets first. Then, we will train it on the latter corpora.
