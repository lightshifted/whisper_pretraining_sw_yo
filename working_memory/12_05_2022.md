# Working Memory

## Monday, December 5th, 2022

Today, while working, I encountered a bug entirely caused by me. It happened when attempting to update bash on VS Code for use with the project. The update involved installing a new version of Python (3.11!) which just threw everything out of whack. Anyways, here's the tasks accomplished today, and future facing work for the team. 

### ‚≠ê Made Progress On:

1. Created `DataLoader1 class used to easily load and process multiple datsets with a consistent format.
2. Created `create_venv.py` script for creating new virtual environments through CLI.
3. `load_interleaved_datasets.py` script for loading and interleaving datasets through CLI.
4. Located 2 new corpora: IARPA BABEL OP2, a Swahili language corpus, and communicated with the author on Kencorpus. Awaiting her response to my response.

### Work Needing Completion:

1. `DatasetLoader` class must be passed through chatgpt for code additions enabling interactions through CLI. 
2. I must inspect error concerning the dowloading of Common Voices 11 Swahili corpus using Huggingface `dataset` import. 
3. Wrap normalization function into DatasetLoader (so this step should be accomplished before step 1 but I'm too lazy at the moment to switch them around. Just hope you've seen this message in time.)
4.
