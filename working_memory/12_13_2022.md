### 💡 Notes / Ideas
* Reviewing the day's accomplishments and work remaining each night is paramount to achieving my goals.
* Each morning, review my list of the day's tasks and craft a daily plan incorporating them.
* Common Voice 11.0 and Google Fleurs corpora are normalized. KenSpeech, Broadcast News, and Babel corpora contain special tokens. Our model will be fine-tuned on the former datasets first. Then, we will train it on the latter corpora.
