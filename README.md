# Fine-Tuned Whisper for Swahili and Yoruba Speech Recognition

In this project, our primary objective is to fine-tune the Whisper model to build state-of-the-art speech recognition systems for the Swahili and Yoruba languages. Our final model will be evaluated on the "test" split of the [Common Voice 11](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0) dataset for our chosen languages.

## Overview

Our goal is to fine-tune the Whisper model to improve the accuracy of speech recognition in the Swahili and Yoruba languages. To do this, we will use a large dataset of audio samples in these languages to train the model and optimize its performance.

We will also develope a user-friendly interface for the speech recognition system that allows users to easily interact with the model and obtain accurate transcriptions of their speech in real-time. This interface can be easily integrated into existing speech recognition applications and platforms to expand their capabilities and make them more accessible to users of the Swahili and Yoruba languages.

Additionally, we will create a community of users and developers who can contribute to the project by providing feedback, suggestions, and additional data to further improve the performance of the speech recognition system. This community allows us to continuously improve the model and make it more effective for users of the Swahili and Yoruba languages.

## Model Weights

Pretrained model weights are stored in HuggingFace repository [here](https://huggingface.co/hedronstone/whisper_event_swahili_small). At the moment, only authorized users have access.

## How to Contribute

If you are interested in contributing to this project, there are several ways you can help:

- Provide feedback and suggestions on the performance of the speech recognition system.
- Offer additional data for fine-tuning the Whisper model.
- Join the community of users and developers to discuss and collaborate on the project.

### Branching Strategy

Only well-tested and reviewed code is merged into the master branch. This helps to avoid merge conflicts and ensures the quality of the codebase.

**Steps:**

1. Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix, based on the master branch.
2. Develop and test the feature or fix in the branch.
3. Create a pull request to merge the branch into the master branch.
4. Review the changes in the pull request and discuss any issues or suggestions with the team.
5. If there are no conflicts, we'll merge the branch into the master branch.
6. If there are conflicts, resolve them in the branch and create a new pull request for our review.
7. Repeat the process for each new feature or bug fix.

To get started, fork this repository and submit a pull request with your proposed changes. We look forward to working with you to improve the accuracy of speech recognition in the Swahili and Yoruba languages.
